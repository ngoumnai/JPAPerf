The Written Word provides pre-compiled binaries for AIX, HP-UX, IRIX,
Redhat Linux, Solaris, Tru64 UNIX. While we make some of the
pre-compiled binaries available on our ftp site,
ftp://ftp.thewrittenword.com, we sell CDs of the binaries at a nominal
cost and offer interim updates between releases, available every
quarter. Pricing information can be found at:
  http://www.thewrittenword.com/products

A yearly subscription provides you with four releases throughout the
year and, for an optional fee, interim updates to packages on the CD
between releases. The interim updates also include patches, security
fixes, new releases to existing packages, and new packages not
available until the next release.

If your organization uses free software and would benefit from having
us maintain it, please contact us at sales@thewrittenword.com or at
